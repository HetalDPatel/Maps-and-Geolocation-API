# Maps-and-Geolocation-API
Integrate a web mapping service into an application. Used the Geolocation API to integrate user location into a web application. Used a Geocoding API to determine GPS co-ordinates from address information.

*****Assignment Requiremenst*****
Create an application that is focused on a Google Map and meets the following minimum requirements.

Your application should be designed for some type of user... e.g. someone who wants to know the locations of parks in Hamilton, someone who wants to donate clothes in Hamilton, a tourist to Hamilton looking to see interesting things, someone who wants to know what wineries are available in Niagara-On-The-Lake, etc.  Exactly who you design your application for is up to you, but you should have some user in-mind that you are making the application for.  This assignment is a chance to build something that you can show off during a job interview or as part of your portfolio, so pick something you're passionate about!

When your application loads in the browser it should feature a Google Map prominently, the map should be the focus of the application.  Incorporate the following features into your application:

At least 10 markers should be displayed on the map when the page first loads.
When a marker on the map is clicked, it should have an infowindow that appears which displays some information about that location (perhaps the address, the name of the location, etc.).  At least some of the information displayed for each location should be unique to that location (e.g. the name of the business, etc.).
At least two buttons on the website that allow you to filter which markers display on the map.  When one of these buttons is clicked, only locations of a certain "type" should be featured on the map.
e.g. three buttons for displaying only indoor skating rinks, only outdoor skating rinks, or all skating rinks
e.g. a button to display only museums and a button to display only waterfalls 
Allow the user to put a marker for their location on the map via clicking a geolocation button.
Display this map marker using a different icon than the standard marker.
Allow the user to put a marker for their location on the map via entering an address into an input textbox.
Display this map marker using a different icon than the standard marker, the same icon as if they used geolocation.
Allow the user to obtain directions from their current location marker to another location marker on the map.
How you implement this is up to you, it could be a directions link in the infowindow of each marker for example.
But it should be something easy to use, for example you could have drop-down menus that allow you to select from lists of origin and destination locations.
But whatever you choose, do not have two input textboxes and ask the user to manually type in both origin and destination addresses, this will not any receive marks.
Implement one feature we did not go over in our example code from this documentation: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview (Links to an external site.).
For example, do directions by walking instead of car, or use the Google Streetview feature, etc.
If you are unsure what to focus your application on, I suggest looking at the data sets provided by Open Hamilton: https://open.hamilton.ca (Links to an external site.).  Open Hamiton provides data sets for everything from park locations to restaurants and hotels.  You could use one data set or several data sets from this website to help you make your application.

Your application should be professional in design and appearance.  Style buttons, inputs and other website elements.  You may use Bootstrap or external styles if you wish (but provide a reference if you use external styles).
Provide a plaintext file called app.txt that contains a few sentences describing the type of user you built your application for, and the feature you chose to implement that we did not go over with our in-class examples.
